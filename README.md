# XXX

This package defines a type of *enumerations*, along with combinators
for building and manipulating them.  An enumeration is a finite or
countably infinite sequence of values, represented as a function from
an index to a value. Hence it is possible to work with even very large
finite sets.  Enumerations also naturally support (uniform) random
sampling.

The package also defines a type of *size-stratified* enumerations,
where the structures of each size are enumerated separately.

Note the goal of this package is *not* to enumerate values of Haskell
types; there already exist many other packages to do that (XXX).
Rather, the goal is simply to provide an abstract framework for
working with enumerations of any values at all.  XXX motivation:
disco.

XXX note connections to theory of species.
